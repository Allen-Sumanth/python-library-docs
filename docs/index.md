# Welcome!

Seawars is a competitive programming game, where you orchestrate bots to mine algae, fight and dominate the grid-based mining field. Plan and build bots, and compete for domination over against an opponent who orchestrates their own bot troops.

You'll be programming the Oceanmaster using the Oceanmaster Python library, which will spawn and control the bots that battle it out against your opponent. This documentation serves as a guide to the general gameplay, as well as detailed documentation for the OceanMaster Python Library.
